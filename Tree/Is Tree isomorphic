Two trees are called isomorphic if one can be obtained from another by a series of flips, i.e. by swapping left and right children of several nodes. Any number of nodes at any level can have their children swapped. Two empty trees are isomorphic.




    //this is important tree question for the interview ..... expect a variation
   bool isIsomorphic(Node *root1,Node *root2)
    {
        if(root1==NULL and root2==NULL) return true;
        if(root1==NULL || root2==NULL) return false;
        if(root1->data!=root2->data) return false;
        
        bool a=isIsomorphic(root1->left,root2->left) and isIsomorphic(root1->right,root2->right);
        bool b=isIsomorphic(root1->left,root2->right) and isIsomorphic(root1->right,root2->left);
        return a||b;
    }
