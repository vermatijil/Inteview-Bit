For Given Number A, find if it's a COLORFUL number or not.

COLORFUL number:
A number can be broken into different contiguous sub-subsequence parts. 
Suppose, a number 3245 can be broken into parts like 3 2 4 5 32 24 45 324 245. 
And this number is a COLORFUL number, since product of every digit of a contiguous subsequence is different
Return 1 if A is a COLORFUL number, else return 0


A = 23
2 3 23
2 -> 2
3 -> 3
23 -> 6
this number is a COLORFUL number since the product of every digit of a sub-sequence is different.


//this is an important apprach in the main function please consider and try to implement in other questions as well

int Solution::colorful(int n)
{
    string s=to_string(n);
    set<int>st;
    for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++)
    {
        int val=1;
        for(int j=i;j<s.size();j++)
        {
            val=val*(s[j]-'0');
            if(st.count(val)) return 0;
            st.insert(val);
        }
    }
    return 1;
}
