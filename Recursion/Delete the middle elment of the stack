Given a stack, delete the middle element of the stack without using any additional data structure.
Middle element:- floor((size_of_stack+1)/2) (1-based indexing) from bottom of the stack.

Note: The output shown by the compiler is the stack from top to bottom.

public:
    //Function to delete middle element of a stack.
    void deleteMid(stack<int>&s, int n)
    {
        if(s.size()==(n+1)/2) 
        {
            s.pop();
            return;
        }
        int top=s.top();
        s.pop();
        deleteMid(s,n);
        s.push(top);
    }
